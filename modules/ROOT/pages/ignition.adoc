= Setting up a Device with Zezere

The disk images do not have a pre-configured user or any passwords set for security reasons. To use the deployment you will need to add your SSH key to the root account using the provisiong service - Zezere.

== Using the Zezere Provisioning Server
When a Fedora IoT system is booted, you will see the Zezere provisioning server URL as well as the MAC address of the device deployed.

Once the Fedora IoT system has been booted, navigate to Zezere on another device. Open the 'SSH Key Management' Tab and add your SSH public key.

Select the 'Claim Unowned Devices' tab and check to see if the newly deployed hardware is displayed.

Select "Claim". The device should now show up under the "Device Management" tab. Under "Device Management", find the MAC address for your new deployment and click "Submit provision request".

After a short period of time, the ssh key should be copied to the root account of the new deployment. Open a terminal and try to ssh to the root account on the IoT host.
Once logged in, create any additional user accounts and optionally set a root password if required.
