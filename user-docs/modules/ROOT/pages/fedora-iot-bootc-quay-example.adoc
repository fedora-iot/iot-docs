= Fedora IoT Bootc Image Example with Quay

== Building and Booting a Fedora IoT Bootc Image

This example walks through building and booting a Fedora IoT bootc image using Quay.io, as well as pushing an update to a booted 
Fedora IoT system.

NOTE: This example is based on the Fedora bootc documentation about building scratch images; reference the upstream docs 
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/bootc/building-from-scratch/#_using_bootc_base_imagectl_build_rootfs[here] for the latest version/information.

NOTE: This example assumes the user has a Quay account with the ability to create custom repositories.

To start, create a `Containerfile.custom` with the following contents:
----
FROM quay.io/fedora-testing/fedora-bootc:rawhide-standard as builder
RUN /usr/libexec/bootc-base-imagectl build-rootfs --manifest=fedora-iot /target-rootfs

FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /target-rootfs/ /
LABEL containers.bootc 1
ENV container=oci
STOPSIGNAL SIGRTMIN+3
CMD ["/sbin/init"]
----

You're now ready to build a Fedora IoT bootc image using the custom containerfile you made earlier. Use this command:
----
podman build --cap-add=all --security-opt=label=type:container_runtime_t \
--device /dev/fuse -t localhost/fedora-iot -f Containerfile.custom .
----

Then, tag your Fedora IoT bootc image:
----
podman tag localhost/fedora-iot:latest quay.io/[quay repository name]:fedora-iot
----

Before pushing to Quay.io, you may need to log in:  
----  
podman login quay.io  
---- 

Push your new Fedora IoT bootc image to Quay.io using the following command. Note that you may need to log in again:
----
podman push quay.io/[quay repository name]:fedora-iot
----

NOTE: The next step uses `podman-bootc`. If you need to install `podman-bootc`, please follow the instructions in the 
https://github.com/containers/podman-bootc[podman-bootc repository]

Now, boot your Fedora IoT bootc image. Open a new terminal window and run:
----
podman-bootc run --filesystem=ext4 quay.io/[quay repository name]:fedora-iot
----

`podman-bootc` will pull your image and boot it inside a VM in the terminal window, 
allowing you to test everything Fedora IoT bootc images have to offer.

== Pushing an Update to your Fedora IoT bootc system

After completing the tutorial above, you now have a functional Fedora IoT bootc system! But what if you need to make a change?
Updating a bootc system is remarkably simple -- just follow the steps below. 

NOTE: This tutorial assumes you have just completed the above tutorial, and have access to a booted Fedora IoT bootc system.

First, navigate to your cloned Fedora Bootc Base Images repository and create a containerfile named `Containerfile.fix` with your desired changes. 

Next, rebuild your `localhost/fedora-iot` image using the new containerfile:
----
podman build --cap-add=all --security-opt=label=type:container_runtime_t \
--device /dev/fuse -t localhost/fedora-iot -f Containerfile.fix .
----

Tag your updated Fedora IoT bootc image:
----
podman tag localhost/fedora-iot:latest quay.io/[quay repository name]:fedora-iot
----

Before pushing to Quay.io, you may need to log in:
----
podman login quay.io
----

Push your updated Fedora IoT bootc image to Quay.io, using the command below:
----
podman push quay.io/[quay repository name]:fedora-iot
----

After successfully pushing, switch back to your virtual machine running your Fedora IoT bootc image. 
Download and queue the updated image for your next reboot:
----
bootc upgrade
----

Run the following command to see your updated image staged for the next reboot:
----
bootc status
----

Reboot your Fedora IoT bootc system and use your new updated image:
----
reboot
----

After rebooting, you may need to ssh back into your Fedora IoT bootc system. To do so, first list all podman-bootc
VMs: 
----
podman-bootc list
----

Then find the ID of your desired machine and run the following:
----
podman-bootc ssh [ID]
----

After reconnecting, run check the status again:
----
bootc status
----

Your updated image should now show up 
as `Booted`, and the previous image as `Rollback`. You have successfully updated your Fedora IoT bootc system!
