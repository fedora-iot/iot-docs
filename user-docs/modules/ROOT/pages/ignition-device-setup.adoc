== Setup a device by using Ignition and a Raw disk image

=== Prerequisites

* You have xref:creating-an-ignition-configuration-file.adoc[created an Ignition configuration file] and is accessible via HTTP/HTTPS.
* You have downloaded a link:https://fedoraproject.org/iot/download[Raw disk image] and copied to media for your device.

=== Edit the boot parameters
As the device boots, edit the kernel args and add the url to your ignition config, for example: `ignition.config.url=http://192.168.122.1/fiot.ign`

== Setup a device by using Ignition and the Simplified Provisioner

=== Prerequisites

* You have xref:creating-an-ignition-configuration-file.adoc[created an Ignition configuration file] and is accessible via HTTP/HTTPS.
* You have downloaded the link:https://fedoraproject.org/iot/download[Simplified Provisioner ISO image] and booted the device from it by
using one of the methods described in xref:booting-the-simplified-provisioner.adoc[Booting the Simplified Provisioner].


=== Edit the boot parameters

Once device has been booted from the Simplified Provisioner the boot menu shows the
following options:
[subs="attributes"]
....
Install Fedora {FedoraVersion}
Test this media & install Fedora {FedoraVersion}
Troubleshooting -->
....

* Select *"Install Fedora {FedoraVersion}"* and press the *"[e]"* key to edit the menu entry.
* Make sure the installation device variable (`coreos.inst.install_dev`) is correct and
append the ignition parameters (e.g.: `{SimplifiedProvisionerKernelIgnitionConfigURL} {SimplifiedProvisionerKernelRdNeedNet}`)
to the `linux` line if not present (e.g.:):
+
[subs="attributes"]
....
### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/10_linux ###
menuentry 'Install Fedora {FedoraVersion}' --class fedora --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
	linux  images/pxeboot/vmlinuz rd.neednet=1 coreos.inst.crypt_root=1 coreos.inst.isoroot=Fedora-{FedoraVersion}-IoT-x86_64 coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/vda coreos.inst.image_file=/run/media/iso/image.raw.xz coreos.inst.insecure quiet {SimplifiedProvisionerKernelIgnitionConfigURL} {SimplifiedProvisionerKernelRdNeedNet}
	initrd images/pxeboot/initrd.img
}
....
* Boot the menu entry by pressing *"[Ctrl-x]"* to boot and install the IoT device

== Verifying the installation

Once the installation has finished and the device has rebooted you should be able to login with the user
configured within the ignition file:
[subs="attributes"]
....
ssh core@${DefaultIoTDeviceIP}
....
