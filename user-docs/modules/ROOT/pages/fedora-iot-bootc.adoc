= Fedora IoT Bootc Images

As part of Fedora's initiative towards bootable containers, you can now create Fedora IoT `bootc` images. These images use standard
OCI/Docker containers as transport but contain all components needed to boot a Fedora IoT system. This allows you to ship updates to
your Fedora IoT system using container images.

`bootc` is part of the standard Fedora IoT distribution. After xref:physical-device-setup.adoc[setting up a Physical Device]
you can use the `bootc` tools to update the system.

Essentially, Fedora IoT `bootc` images retain all the functionality you're used to in Fedora IoT, while leveraging the flexibility
and ease of maintenance provided by `bootc`.
