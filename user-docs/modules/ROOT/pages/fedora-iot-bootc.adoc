= Fedora IoT Bootc Images

As part of Fedora's initiative towards bootable containers, you can now create Fedora IoT bootc images. These images use standard
OCI/Docker containers as transport but contain all components needed to boot a Fedora IoT system. This allows you to ship updates to 
your Fedora IoT system using container images.

Essentially, Fedora IoT bootc images retain all the functionality you're used to in Fedora IoT, while leveraging the flexibility 
and ease of maintenance provided by bootc.
