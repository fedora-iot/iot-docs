= Reference Platforms

Fedora IoT supports the aarch64 (arm64), ARMv7 (arm32) and x86_64 architectures. Support for ARMv7 has been deprecated, with Fedora 36 being the last release.

We only actively support UEFI plaforms so if your device doesn't boot with UEFI it probably won't work.

These reference platforms have been tested and are known to work with Fedora IoT, however their inclusion on this list does not necessarily constitute a release-blocking issue should a bug that is specific to the hardware below be found.

The currently tested reference devices are as follows:

Other devices should work, but aren't being actively tested in the context of IoT.
The list of supported reference devices will expand with time.

== Required resources

The images being created are currently 4GB in size.
The current memory used for testing is 1GB of RAM.
The Fedora IoT base image should run with less,
but of course this limits the amount of container applications that can be run on top of the base OS.
