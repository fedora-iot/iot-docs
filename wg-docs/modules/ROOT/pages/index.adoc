== Communications

We primarily communicate by the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/iot.lists.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora IoT mailing list] and the https://matrix.to/#/#iot:fedoraproject.org[Fedora IoT channel on Matrix].
Check the https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/IoT/[IoT calendar] for meeting times and locations.

== Contributing to Fedora IoT

There's a number of components that make up Fedora IoT.
The upstream source components for general projects like the Zezere and Greenboot reside on the https://github.com/fedora-iot/[Fedora IoT GitHub page].

For the source for Fedora specific things like compose configs, we have the https://pagure.io/group/fedora-iot[Fedora IoT] Pagure organisation which contains the various git repositories for building Fedora IoT.

Docs and upstream component sources are on https://github.com/fedora-iot[GitHub].

Bugs are tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla using the https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=IoT[IoT tracker bug] for bugs reported against other components and the https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?component=IoT&product=Fedora[IoT component] for IoT-specific issues.
